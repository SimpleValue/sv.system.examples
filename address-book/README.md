# sv/system Address Book Example

The main purpose of this example is to show how different components
of sv/system can work together to form a complete web
application. Reagent is used for the frontend part to render a list of
persons, which is requested from the server via sv/rpc. The server
queries the person data from a Datomic (in-memory) database.

A lot of "noise" in terms of files and configuration is generated by
the fact that
[reagent-template](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template)
has been used to generate the scaffold for the project. For a real
project it is recommendable to take a look at projects like
[re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) ([re-frame lein
template](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template)), which provide
more structure / architecture on top of Reagent.

The address-book.system namespace is a good starting point to take a
look at the sv/system related parts of the system.
